<!-- for...of loop. -->
<!-- 
ES6 introduced a new loop construct, for...of loop. 
The best thing about for/of loop is that it provides an
 easy way to loop through iterable objects such as array, string, Map, Set, arguments objects, 
 custom iterables and array-like structures (NodeList).

 SYNTAX:

for(variable of iterable){
	//loop body
}

The variable is declared using let, const or var keyword. of is a keyword.

The for/of loop runs once for each element present in the iterable. And in each iteration, 
the current processing element is assigned to the variable. -->
