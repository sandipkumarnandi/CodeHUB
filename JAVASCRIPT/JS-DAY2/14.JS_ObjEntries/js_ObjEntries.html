<!-- The Object.entries() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs.
 This is the same as iterating with a for...in loop, except that a for...in loop enumerates properties 
 in the prototype chain as well. -->


<!-- The order of the array returned by Object.entries() is the same as that provided by a for...in loop. 
 If there is a need for different ordering, then the array should be sorted first, 
 like Object.entries(obj).sort((a, b) => b[0].localeCompare(a[0]));. -->
