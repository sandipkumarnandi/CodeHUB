<!-- Inheritance class -->
<!-- 
Inheritance is an important concept in Object-Oriented Programming. This is a mechanism that allows 
the child class to acquire all the properties and methods of a parent class (except private properties and methods).
 We use the keyword extends in a class declaration or a class expression to create a child class of another class.

 Note: If there is a constructor present in the subclass, it needs to first call super() before using “this”. -->

<html>
  <body>
    <script>
      // parent class
      class Person {
        constructor(name) {
          this.name = name;
          this.occupation = "unemployed";
        }

        greet() {
          console.log(`Hello ${this.name}.`);
        }
      }

      // inheriting parent class
      class Student extends Person {
        constructor(name) {
          // call the super class constructor and pass in the name parameter
          super(name);

          // Overriding an occupation property
          this.occupation = "Student";
        }

        // overriding Person's method
        greet() {
          console.log(`Hello student ${this.name}.`);
          console.log("occupation: " + this.occupation);
        }
      }

      let p = new Student("Jack");
      p.greet();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- Check the output in browser console
Hello student Jack.
occupation: Student -->

<!-- Uses of Inheritance
Since a child class can inherit all the functionalities of the parent's class, this allows code reusability.
Once a functionality is developed, you can simply inherit it. No need to reinvent the wheel. This allows for cleaner code and easier to maintain.
Since you can also add your own functionalities in the child class, you can inherit only the useful functionalities and define other required features. -->
