<!-- *****************************While Loop *********************-->
<!-- A while statement in JavaScript executes until our boolean condition evaluates to true. This loop is an entry controlled loop.

1.If the test condition returns false, then control passes to the statement just after the loop.
2. If the test condition returns true, the loop body is executed and the condition is tested again.
Syntax:
while ( boolean condition)
  statement -->
