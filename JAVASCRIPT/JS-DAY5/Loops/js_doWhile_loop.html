<!-- do while loop -->

<!-- This is an exit controlled loop; the loop body executes at least once, even if the condition is not true. 
This is because the condition is tested when the loop body ends.
 If the condition returns true, the code inside the loop executes again. 
 If it returns false, the JavaScript interpreter exits the loop. -->

<!-- 
 Syntax:
 do
{
  //code executed at least once
}while (condition); -->
